I am a computer science major in my second year at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). I have changed majors to this major as of this semester.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, part 1

    This was one of my favorite labs because it marked the beginning of my first time ever writing and pushing code. Although it is very simple, as it was just hello world, I believe that the hello world code is one of the most funniest and newbie lines to be printed out in the computer science world. This will forever be my all time favorite lab because this is the funniest to me and I will always remember when people I meet or my younger cousins begin coding and have to write their first hello world.

* Lab 7, part 2

    This was one of my favorite labs because I had just got a new partner who is now a good friend, and this is one where I really had my first break through with using my brain's logic and applying it to code. I found it really interesting how we had to create equations and parameters for each of the street signs and him and I were debating very much on how the parameters should be set. It did not make sense while we were at school but once I worked on it at home, I had my breakthrough and everything compiled nicely, but most importantly, there were no more logic errors.

* Lab 9, part 2

    This was a fun lab because it involved more logic. Checking for overlapping schedules was a very good and fun lab idea and me and my new partner were very stuck on this. Once we got help from our lab instructors, we were able to use their guidance and make our breakthrough and finish and submit this lab.
